Problem Statement
-----------------
> Build a social TODO List web application that uses the Twitter to
authenticate and handle the following use case:
>
> 1. An anonymous user opens the application
> 2. The application prompts the user to connect/signin with Twitter
> 3. The user goes to twitter and allows the app, then returns to the app
> 4. A user account is created for the authenticating user using the
> details (name, username, etc) in their twitter account.
> 5. The user is able to create a TODO lists, each containing multiple
> TODO items, each with an "Is completed" checkbox.
> 6. The user is able to add items to the TODO list, and on the "new
> TODO item" screen, there's a checkbox that allows you to cross post
> your new TODO as a Tweet on Twitter.
> 7. The app will automatically post a tweet when you "check off" an
item like "John Smith just complete 'Mow the Lawn'!"
> 8. You should have fun building the app. :)
>
> The application should have all normal fundamentals for input
> validation, error handling, edge case handling, etc. and should be
> deployed somewhere that you can send us a simple URL to view and use
> it, you should also be prepared to send us the full source code for
> review.
>
> Language/environment doesn't matter, use whatever tools you'd like.
>
> We know that not everyone's a designer, so no worries here. We're
> looking at the functionality first and foremost, but extra points for
> any other awesome ideas, design polish or functionality you decide to
> add
