# Install the vendor libraries
#
# The ~/code directory, where your application lives on dotCloud, is erased by
# the newer version of your code, each time you push.
# So, we would need to reinstall all the vendor libraries if we left them
# inside ~/code.
# That's why we install the vendor libraries outside of ~/code and create a
# symlink to it.
